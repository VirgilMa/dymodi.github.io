### 1. Come up with the Idea

* Before talk to others, remember the following checklist:
  * Is this work a simple piling of two or more ideas?
  * Has this topic been discussed by others? Can you articulate your innovation?

### 2. Discuss with Professor

* Scope
  * The problem you want to solve and the solution you provide must be generic, e.g. instant delivery but not food delivery.
  * The experiments and evaluation you did can be only a subset or a special case of you scope, e.g. we test dispatching algorithm on a grid in ELE.ME platform.
* Innovation
  * Instead of list several innovations, it will be better to articulate one major difference or innovation.
* Solution
  * Instead of manipulate a very complex method with many components and parameters, it will be better to design a simple system with one major innovative part and show that is working.
  * Instead of coming up with brand new solutions, it will be better to import existing solutions.
* Advanced Design
  - Discover and solve the advanced problem by removing the assumptions. For example, if we do not assume that rider are walking at a constant speed (1m/s) indoor, the problem will become more complexity.
* Before study, remember the following checklist:
  * Make sure the whole project (motivation, problem, solution, advanced design, evaluation) is accepted by the Professor.

### 3. Study

* Prepare data to have a whole image of the data and problem.
* Find well-known methods in the field as baseline.

### 5. Writing

For System Paper writing, please find guides in this [post](https://github.com/dymodi/dymodi.github.io/blob/master/Research/Writing/How-to-Write-a-System-Paper.md).

### 6. Presentation

* When others ask questions, try to find out why they ask "this" question.
