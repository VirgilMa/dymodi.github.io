### Come up with the Idea

### Discussion with the Professor

Before talk to others, try the following check list:

* Is this work a simple piling of two or more ideas?
* Has this topic been discussed by others? Can you articulate your innovation?

### Before Study

* Make sure the whole project (motivation, problem, solution, advanced design, evaluation) is accepted by the Professor.

### Before Writing




### Advanced Design
Discover and solve the advanced problem by removing the assumptions. For example, if we do not assume that rider are walking at a constant speed (1m/s) indoor, the problem will become more complexity.
