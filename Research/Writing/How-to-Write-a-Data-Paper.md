When writing a research paper, keep the following in mind (guideline from NSF for proposal writing):

- The importance of the problems addressed
- The novelty of the proposed solutions
- The technical depth
- The potential impact

Also keep in mind that **problem is as important as** (if not more important than) **the solution**.

Generally speaking, data paper refers to the paper published in **KDD** and **AAAI**.

## Title

Note the following points:

* Title should be concise.
* Title should show the most innovative part of the paper
* Title should not be misleading, that is, not include terminology in other fields.


## Abstract

Abstract is a short version of Introduction, a tiny version of whole paper. For application-oriented paper, it will better to articulate that we have "deployed" the algorithm.

In an Abstract, we mainly provide the following four pieces of information:

* Background (and Vision)
* Problems (and Gaps/Challenges)
* Our methods to solve the problems (narrow the gap)
* Innovation (Can come from problem or solution)
* Our achievements (performance)

## Indroduction

Introduction is possibly the most important section of the paper, since reviewers and reads might choose to continue reading or give up after reading the Introduction. Usually we have the following paragraphs in the Introduction:

* The background (story)
  * e.g. In Airbnb 2018 KDD paper, the mechanism of pricing in Airbnb is introduced here.
* Challenges - motivations - opportunities
* Related works
  * Works of related innovation part should be introduced. e.g. In Airbnb 2018 KDD paper, works related to Airbnb is introduced since the Airbnb itself is the most important innovation.
* The solution we proposed
* The contribution of this paper



## Related Works

Taxnonmy

We need to find a design space that excludes all the other existing works.



## Overview / Problem Definition

Note that this section is **not** a must.

* Framework
* Problem definition

Since usually some classical models with some modification are used in the data paper, we need to first formulate the problem as an classical problem.



## Method / Design / Solution

Note that usually this part will extend to several sections.

* Framework
* Design 1
* Design 2



## Experiment

* Experiment Setting
  * Can be online A/B testing
* Parameter Setting
* Evaluation Metric
* Baselines
* Datasets
* Performance



## Conclusion
