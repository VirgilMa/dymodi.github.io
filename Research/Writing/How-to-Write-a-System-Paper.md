When writing a research paper, keep the following in mind:

- The importance of the problems addressed
- The novelty of the proposed solutions
- The technical depth
- The potential impact

## How to Write the Abstract

Abstract is a short version of Introduction, a tiny version of whole paper.

In an Abstract, we mainly provide the following four pieces of information:

* Background (and Vision)
* Problems (and Gaps)
* Our methods to solve the problems (narrow the gap)
* Our achievements (performance)

## How to Write the Indroduction

Introduction is possibly the most important section of the paper, since reviewers and reads might choose to continue reading or give up after reading the Introduction. Usually we have the following paragraphs in the Introduction:

* The background (story)
* Challenges and motivations
* Related works
* The solution we proposed
* The contribution of this paper
