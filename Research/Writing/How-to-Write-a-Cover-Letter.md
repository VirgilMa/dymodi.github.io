The following guidelines are based on Shuai Wang's feedback on the Crowd Delivery.



* Never worry the cover letter gets too long, as long as it is necessary.
* If you add some contents/figures/tables in the revised draft, better copy them in the cover letter. Some reviewer won't have time to read the revised paper again after reading the cover letter.
* Each reviewer may only read their own part, if several reviewers had the same question, answer them respectively in each part. 
* Don't be too flinching in replying the comments, you should show your confidence.
* Both positive and negative comments should be replied.
* If a comment is made for a real error, better not explain too much.
