title: How to Write an Experience Paper

When writing a research paper, keep the following in mind (guideline from NSF for proposal writing):

- The importance of the problems addressed
- The novelty of the proposed solutions
- The technical depth
- The potential impact



In an experience paper, usually we conduct some **measurement studies** on an interesting and typical system built by ourselves.



It will be better that the paper focus one or two very **counterintuitive** observations that can change the existing understanding of the technology in the community. Otherwise, some small new findings or contextual impactors is also acceptable.



According to the CFP of *MobiCom* experience paper, in experience paper we share to the community the experiences with **implementation**, **deployment**, and **operations** of a real world system. Desirable papers are expected to contain real data as well as descriptions of the **practical lessons learned**. The experience papers will be evaluated by the program committee, primarily for (i) richness of their data or experiences, (ii) inferences drawn or lessons learned, (iii) discovery of new problems, and (iv) their impact/potential impact on current and future mobile systems and wireless networks, as well as on society. 



## Introduction

* Background of the techniques to be discussed (e.g. WSN/LORA/Beacon).

## Related Works

The related works here might be more comprehensive compared to technical papers.

## Implementation/Deployment/Operation

* An overview of the system.

* Some interesting technical details in building the system, such as hardware, software, protocol

## Measurement Methodology

* Data gathered
* Metrics (Y axis)
* Impacting parameters (X axis)
* Baselines (Legends)

## Lessons Learned/Results

* Limitations of existing solutions, that are also the guide for future research directions.
* Observations that indicate inaccurate assumption in existing works, which can be system-level or technical details.
* New solution or suggestions that correspond to the observations found.
* Data to be released to the community.
