In this post, I summarize some prepared parts that can be used in future papers.



### Beacon System 

"We build a large scale real world indoor localization system basede on iBeacon protocol. In building this system, we met the following pracitcal problems and address them with novel methods."



### Basic Design and Advanced Design

"For the sake of clarity in presentation, we begin our design with a simplified assumption that it takes at most time $$\tau$$ to transmit one packet between two nodes successfully. We will address the practical issues related to packet loss and queuing delays in Section IV."
