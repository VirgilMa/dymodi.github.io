In this post, I summarize some prepared parts that can be used in future papers.



### Time Dependent Network

[1] We first transform the "duty-cycle-aware broadcast problem" into a shortest path problem in a time-coverage graph. Assume that the network topology and the active/dormant patterns are known, this graph problem is solvable through a centralized dynamic programming algorithm.

关于Time-Converage Graph的内容也可以借鉴这篇文章中的叙述。



### Beacon System 

"We build a large scale real world indoor localization system basede on iBeacon protocol. In building this system, we met the following pracitcal problems and address them with novel methods."



### Basic Design and Advanced Design

"For the sake of clarity in presentation, we begin our design with a simplified assumption that it takes at most time $$\tau$$ to transmit one packet between two nodes successfully. We will address the practical issues related to packet loss and queuing delays in Section IV."
