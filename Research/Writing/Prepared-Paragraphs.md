In this post, I summarize some prepared parts that can be used in future papers.

Since some of the contents are from other papers, please remember to adjust before referring.



### Time Dependent Network

[1] We first transform the "duty-cycle-aware broadcast problem" into a shortest path problem in a time-coverage graph. Assume that the network topology and the active/dormant patterns are known, this graph problem is solvable through a centralized dynamic programming algorithm.

关于Time-Converage Graph的内容也可以借鉴这篇文章中的叙述。



### TSP with Time-Dependent Service Times

[2] This observation implies that a TSP solution may not be optimal for the TSP-TS even when all customers have the same service time function and waiting does not provide any reduction in the total service time. Moreover, it shows that our problem may not correspond to the TSP even when all customers have the same quadratic service time func- tion (with a unique minimum).



### Beacon System 

"We build a large scale real world indoor localization system basede on iBeacon protocol. In building this system, we met the following pracitcal problems and address them with novel methods."



### Basic Design and Advanced Design

"For the sake of clarity in presentation, we begin our design with a simplified assumption that it takes at most time $$\tau$$ to transmit one packet between two nodes successfully. We will address the practical issues related to packet loss and queuing delays in Section IV."
