**(The background of food delivery system)**

In recent years, with the prevalence of the mobile Internet and sharing economy, online food ordering and delivery becomes a prosperous market. Driven by the mobile Internet technololy, a new business model is emerging with a centralized platform serving customers, restaurants and riders at the same time [][][]. Restaurants can operate online shops on the platform and accept orders while customers can choose from plenty of restaurants nearby from the cellphone APP provided by the platform. The food delivery tasks will be dispatched to registered and crowdsourced riders according to their location and destination. As the platform provides convenient service for all three sections, some problems also restrain the platform from achieving high efficiency dispatching. The most critical problem is to estimate the rider's travelling time among restaurants and customers. The estimation must be tight because food must be delivered within limited time (usually within 30 minutes) for fresh quality and the time-out case would be punished with costs.

**(The differences between taxis dispatching and rider sharing)**

The food delivery system is much more complex than taxi dispatching system in the following aspects:
1. The taxi system include three phases: order dispatching, picking and delivering. However, the food delivery system envolves fours phases: order dispatching, rider's arrival at the restaurant, picking meal at the restaurant, and delivering to the customer.
2. The taxi system only envolves two roles: the driver and the customer. While in the food delivery system, there are threes roles: the courier, the restaurant and the customer.


**(Challenges and motivations)**

A practical food delivery is a complex system with many constraints and objectives. The food needs to be delivered usually within 30 minutes to guarantee the quality of the food. Time-out will also be punished with penalites for both platform and riders. The delivery time is the key point in the system: the platform needs to estimate the time for dispatching, the rider wants to take as many orders as possible within the time constraints, and the customers want their meal to be delivered as soon as possible. However, simple estimation methods are not applicable for food delivery system due to many pracitical isses: (1) The physical distance of two POI does reflects the time needed from one place to the other due to differnt floors and building layouts; (2) The time needed to prepare the meal varies from restaurant; (3) The time needed for the rider to travel between POIs varies with the rider's age and familiarity with the POIs (4) External factors such as weather and rush hour also affects the delivery time to some extent.

**(Upper layer application based on time map)**

Besides delivery time estimation and delivery tasks dispatching, many other application can be developed based on the time-based map to resolve the practical problems met in food delivery system. For example, (1) the fraud behavior of riders and restaurants can be detected in a anomally detection manner; (2) Dynamic pricing can be conducted according to the rider's behavior; (3) Wrong POI information (can be a severe problem for many other application) can be detected and corrected.  

**(Our solution)**

In this paper, we build a food delivery system consists of four layers: (1) Physical layer for collecting reald world data; (2) Data layer for storing and preprocessing data; (3) Model layer to build and analyse a time-based map to estimate rider's travelling time between restaurants, this is the main contribution of the paper; (4) Application layer for real world needs. We take POI correction and delivery time estimation as example in this paper. 

**(The contribution of this paper)**

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that uses a (dynamic) time-based map to estimate the travelling time of the riders in a delivery system. The effectiveness of the system is verified a large scale real world system. The scale of the system is larger than any other system studied before in the followings aspects: For the physical layer, we have more than 15,000 beacons in 15,000 shops in Shanghai. For the sensor layer, more than 20,000 riders act as "sensors" with cellphone with them. Particularly, in the former studies the many, more than 600 types have cellphone have been involved in the system, which shows the effectiveness of our system in real world scenario.

## 3 System Overview
The system overview can be seen in the Figure 1.
<p align = "center">

</p>

The multi-dimensional delivery graph is a conceptual kernel and can be implemented with many ways: MDS, machine learning model such as rbf-svm or Deep NN. As long as the model's input is the arc and can output a estimated time is supported 

### 3.1 Application
Based on the time map, we can measure and estimate the time difference or time similarity between two places (events). Some applications can be:
* Estimate delivery time by summing rider's estimated trip.
* Dispatching based on rider's arrival time at next restaurant.
* Rider behavior monitoring based on metric of his trace on the map and his reported trip.

## 4 Multi-Dimensional Delivery Graph
Since new machine learning methods are coming out every day. We are not restrain ourselves in a fixed machine learning methods. Instead, we are offering some basic operation and interface, different ml algorithms that can fullfill the basic requirements can all be used in this space to estimate the delivery time.

<!--- This is an old version defining space ---
Acutally, we should call it a space instead of a map. It is similar as a metric space in the sense that a distance function is defined. However the symmetry condition is obviously not met and we cannot prove triangle law. 
Similar as metric space, temporal delivery space is an ordered pair $(M,t)$ where $M$ is a set and $t$ is a metric on $M$, i.e., a function.) 
$$t: M \times M \to \mathbb{R}$$
Also note that temporal delivery space is not a metric space since symmetry ($d(x,y) = d(y,x)$) does not holds. Consider a simple case measure the time need between to two shops where one shop is in the first floor and the other in the 5th floor. If there is no elevator and the rider has to use the stairs, it can be expected that the time needed to go from 5th floor is less than that needed to go from first floor to 5th floor.

Multi-Dimensional Delivery Graph is a tuple $(V,A,\tau)$ where $V$ is a the vertices set (including restaurants and customers), $A$ is the arc set, function $\tau: E \to \mathbb R$ is the time function. 

**Vertex**: an element $p \in V$, or a point in the temporal delivery space.

**Arc**: an ordered pair $(s, d) \in A$ where $s \in V, d \in V$. Here $s$ is the source position, $d$ is the destination position.

**Time function**ï¼š$\tau(s,d)$ the time needed for the arc $(s,d)$

Specifically, $\tau$ measures the time needed to travel from a point to another point in the delivery space. Note that the point in the delivery is not necessary a place, since we have more dimensions besides latitude and longtitude. Floor, weather, rush hour/non-rush hour can also be dimensions to describe a point in the delivery space. The dimension selection will be introduce int the **4.1** section, which is more or less similar like feature engineering in machine learning. the function $\tau$ will be discussed in the **4.2** section. 

The *basic assumption* is that the time needed to travel between to places is determined and only determined by the related factors such as lat/lon, floor, weather.

### 4.1 Dimension selection (Feature selection)

Vertices set features:

|Name               |Symbol     |Type           |Code value |Description                        |
|---                |---        |---            |---        |---                                |
|Position Type      |$typ$      |$\mathbb{N}$   |0,1        |0:restaurant; 1:customer           |
|Latitude           |$lat$      |$\mathbb{R}$   |--         |The latitude of the vertex         |
|Longitude          |$lon$      |$\mathbb{R}$   |--         |The longitude of the vertex        |
|Floor              |$flr$      |$\mathbb{N}$   |--         |The floor of the place             |
|Average Cook Time  |$ckt$      |$\mathbb{R}$   |--         |The restaurant's average cook time |

Arc set features:

|Name           |Symbol     |Type           |Code value |Description                            |
|---            |---        |---            |---        |---                                    |
|Month of Year  |$mon$      |$\mathbb{N}$   |1,2,...,12 |The month in the year                  |
|Day of Week    |$day$      |$\mathbb{N}$   |1,2,...,7  |The day in the week                    |
|Weather        |$wth$      |$\mathbb{N}$   |0,1,...,5  |The weather. 0: sunny; 1: cloudy; etc. |
|Distance       |$dst$      |$\mathbb{R}$   |--         |The physical distance from $s$ to $d$  |


For delivery system, the data is organized order by order, for each order, the following information is maitained:

|Field          |Description                        |
|---            |---                                |
|Order ID       |Unique ID for tracking the order   |
|Rider          |The rider who deliver the order    |
|Restaurant     |The restaurant that make the meal  |
|Customer       |The customer who make the order    |
|Order Time     |The date and time the order is make|

Although theoretically we can compute the time needed for any event, some event has no physical meanings such as  the time needed from a resutaurant on "a winter, Tuesday, sunny day" to a restauant on a "summer, Friday, rainy day". We summarize some typical arcs(event) $(s,d)$ as following:

*Staying*: $s=d$

*Picking*: $typ_{d} = 0$

*Sending*: $typ_{d} = 1$

*Delivering*: $typ_{s} = 0$, $typ_{d} = 1$

The typical arcs are illustrated in the following figure:

</p>

Feature selection is achieved with correlation analysis.

### 4.2 Time estimation
After the features are determined, the time estimation can be implemented in many ways. 
Such as, RBF SVM.

A intial result for picking arc time estimation using SVR RBF is:

</p>

If we evaluate the performance using the following definition:
$$accuracy = \frac{\left| t_{predict} - t_{measure} \right| < t_{threshold}}{n_{total}}$$
then we have:

|$t_{threshold}$|1 minutes  |2 minutes  |3 minutes  |
|---            |---        |---        |---        |
|$accuracy$     |0.61       |0.92       |1          |
