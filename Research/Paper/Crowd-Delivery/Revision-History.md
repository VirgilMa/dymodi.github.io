Here we reply to the weaknesses indicated by the reviewers from SenSys.

**Reviewer A, RevExp 2, OveMer 1**

Strengths:

1. Using public transport to delivery package with time guarantee is interesting.  
2. Reasonable theoretical analysis is provided.

Weaknesses:

1. No real supporting example applications. 
   1. Hard to implemente such a large system in real world.
2. Some important design considerations and assumptions appear to be not reasonable or unrealistic. 
3. Limited technical novelty. 
4. Relatively weak relevance to the scope of interest of SenSys.
   1. Submit to UbiComp



**Reviewer B, RevExp 1, OveMer 2**

Strengths:

1. The proposed idea could be disruptive: crowdsource the delivery of goods by piggybacking on top of standard commuters. 
2. The evaluation is based on large real data sets and the authors also perform a small-scale experiment.

Weaknesses:

1. Some of the constraints/parameters seem to be chosen to fit the model, not to fit realistic scenarios. Also some parameters are presented without a clear explanation. These points may affect the correctness of the approach.
2. The authors compare their approach with naive alternatives. 
3. Not a well written paper. Some of the notation and methods are not clear. There are several typos and grammatical errors.



**Reviewer C, RevExp 3, OveMer 3**

Strengths:

1. The work is novel, and reasonably well-evaluated both from the offline large data set and with some small scale in-field experiments.

Weaknesses:

1. Lack of significant real-world experimentation, weak connection with Sensys scope.
