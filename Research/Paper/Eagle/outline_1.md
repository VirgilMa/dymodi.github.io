# Large Scale Offline Data Collecting

## 1 INTRODUCTION

* The importance of the problems addressed
* The novelty of the proposed solutions
* The technical depth
* The potential impact

**(The background of food delivery system)**

**(Challenges and motivations)**

**(Related works)**

**(The solution we proposed)**

**(The contribution of this paper)**


## 2 Motivation
**(Challenges and motivations)**

Offline data collecting is much more challenging than online data collecting due to many factors: The installation of IoT devices is time consuming and expensive; the measurements are subject to uncertainty due to sensing errors and other disturbances.

Challenges:
* Deployment in the physical world of large scale BLE-based data gathering system
    * Large scale IoT design lacks physical world depolyment. (Proof: [][])
    * Studies with real world deployment is small scale. (Proof: [][])
    * Different from typical scenarios: smart home, art museum, individual mall. (Detailed description)
* Security and privacy protection 
    * Ubiquitous BLE beacons has the risk of revealing privacies
    * （Similar as "Secure IoT"）
* Data inconsistency validation and correction
    * Pervasive "dirty" data in the real world. (More explanition.)
    * Wrong data leads to wrong decision. (An example.)
* Green offline data gathering
    * "Green penalty" in the optimization problem of beacon deployment. (A advanced version of deployment strategy).
    * "Green beacon" (energy efficient in hardware design and broadcasting?)
