[1] is one of the most cited paper in the anomaly detection field. Different key assumptions are used in different methods to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. According to [1], outliers detection methods can be categorized into **classification-based**, **nearest neighbor-based**, **clustering-based**, and **statistical techniques**. 

**Contextual anomaly,** as an interesting type of anomalies, is also studied in [1].
