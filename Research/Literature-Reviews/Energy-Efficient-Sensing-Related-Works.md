**Taxonomy**

* Energy saving solution: Compressing, Sensor (GPS) management
* Applications: Wildlife monitoring, GPS localization

**Comments**

* A common method is to use other (e.g. cheap) sensors to detect the user states and only turn on other sensors when necessary.

**Special Topics**

* EEMSS: A Framework of Energy Efficient Mobile Sensing, *MobiSys09*
  * Taxonomy: Sensor management
  * Solution: Detect user states and only turn on all sensor after transition.
* SenseLess: Less is More, *MobiHeld09*
  * Taxonomy: Sensor management
  * Solution: Use the less expensive sensors more often, and use the more expensive sensors less frequently. 
* a-Loc: Energy-Accuracy Trade-off for Continuous Mobile Device Location, *MobiSys10*
  * Taxonomy: Sensor management
  * Solution: Adaptes sensor energy (accuracy) to application needs and sensor characteristics.
* RAPS: Energy-Efficient Rate-Adaptive GPS-based Positioning, *MobiSys10*
  * Taxonomy: GPS management
  * Solution: Detect user states and only turn on GPS when necessary.
  * Application: GPS localization
* Energy Efficient GPS Acquisition with Sparse-GPS, *IPSN14*
