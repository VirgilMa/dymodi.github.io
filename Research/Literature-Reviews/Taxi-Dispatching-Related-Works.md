## Summary

The existing taxi dispatching algorithms are designed to reduce autonomous vehicle balancing costs and taxis’ total idle distance [1].



## Review for Individual Paper

In paper [1], the author proposed a receding horizon control framework that incorporates predicted demand model and real-time sensing data.
