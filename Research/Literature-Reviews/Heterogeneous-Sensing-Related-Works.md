# Related Works of Heterogeneous Sensing

**Taxonomy**

* Heterogeneity types: device, operating system, environment, user,
* Solution types: deep NN,

**Comments**



**Special Topics**

* Smart devices are different:
  * Taxonomy: device, operaiting system
  * Pros: Very solid experiments.
  * Cons: Only consider limited heterogeneous (36 devices, 9 users); Environment diversity is not considered.
