Heterogeneity is problem that widely met in research and applications. It is said in [SenSys12, IODetector] that "since the antenna gain may vary across different mobile phone models, it is hard to accurately map different RSS values to different environments." It is also said in [TMC14] that "environmental changes impact the transmission channel between devices". Similar conclusions can also been found in [SenSys12, CrowdMon], [iiWAS16].



**Taxonomy**

* Heterogeneity types: device, operating system, data density, user, environment,
* Solution types: deep NN, transfer learning, Fingerprinting, clustering, interpolation, Feature selection, 

**Comments**

* A common cons is limited heterogeneity
* No real world application is conducted no feedback from real world applications.

**Special Topics**

* Modellet: Experiencing and Handling the Diversity, *MobiCom 14*
  * Taxonomy: date density, environment, Fingerprinting
  * Cons:
    * Limited heterogeneity (13 deployment venues)
    * Device diversity is not considered.
* Smart Devices are Different, *SenSys 15*
  * Taxonomy: device, clustering+interpolation
  * Pros: Very solid experiments.
  * Cons: 
    * Limited heterogeneity (36 devices, 9 users); 
    * Environment diversity is not considered (actually only accelerator related heterogeneities are considered).
* DeepSense, *WWW17*
  * Taxonomy: user, deep NN
  * Pros: Solid experiments, 
  * Cons:
    * Limited heterogeneity (20 mobile phones, 9 users, 6 activities)
    * Mainly consider the heterogeneity of noisy measurement.
* CrossSense: Cross-Site and Large-Scale WiFi Sensing, *MobiCom 18*
  * Taxonomy: user, environment, transfer learning,
  * Pros: Solid experiments and rich results
  * Cons: 
    * Limited heterogeneity (100 users, 40 gestures, 1.2 million wireless activity samples)
    * Training user needed;
    * Training user needs to do the same thing in both training and deployment environment;
* Widar3.0: Zero-Effort Cross-Domain Gesture Recognition with Wi-Fi, *MobiSys19*
  * Taxonomy: user, environment, Feature selection
  * Pro: Find features independent of data domain
  * Cons: Device not considered.
