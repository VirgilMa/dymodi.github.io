# Related Works of Inaccurate Labelling


"Inaccurate Labelling", as its name suggests, is how we handle inaccurate labels in machine learning problmes. Usually we assume the labelling is available and accurate, while in practice, labelling can be inaccurate. Here is a simple survey on this problem.

In [1], a time shift label is added to the dataset and a multi-label problem is solved to handle inaccurate labelling problem.

[2] provides two ways to reduce the relying on large amount of labelled data for supervised machine learning. First, **semi-supervised learning** can be used, including *self-training* and *co-training*.
