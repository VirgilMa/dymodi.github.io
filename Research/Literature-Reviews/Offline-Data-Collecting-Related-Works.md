[comment]: # (Related Works of Offline Data Collecting)

## "Related Work" Section for paper "Offline data collecting system"

Offline data collecting is much more challenging than online data collecting due to many factors. Some researchers tried to tackle the problem from different viewpoints in recent years: a cyber-physical- human system (CPHS) framework is proposed in [1]. Leaks in the water network can be localized based on sensing data, geophysical data, human input, and simulation/modeling engines.

### Design Space


## Individual Review

[1] provides an example frame for gathering offline data from heterogeneous data sources and fusing them for a specific purpose. 

It is stated in [1] that "The installation of IoT devices is time consuming and expensive; furthermore their measurements are subject to uncertainty due to sensing errors and measurement correlations. To abstract out correct information with limited IoT observations in a timely manner, sophisticated and high performance algorithms are required."
