## "Related Work" Section for paper "Eagle"

Online data gathering ...[2]

Offline data gathering is much more challenging than online data collecting due to many factors. Some researchers tried to tackle the problem from different viewpoints in recent years: a cyber-physical- human system (CPHS) framework is proposed in [1]. Leaks in the water network can be localized based on sensing data, geophysical data, human input, and simulation/modeling engines.

## Individual Review

[1] provides an example frame for gathering offline data from heterogeneous data sources and fusing them for a specific purpose. 

It is stated in [1] that "The installation of IoT devices is time consuming and expensive; furthermore their measurements are subject to uncertainty due to sensing errors and measurement correlations. To abstract out correct information with limited IoT observations in a timely manner, sophisticated and high performance algorithms are required."

[5] introduces an integrated operating system: VITAL-OS that can work with multiple IoT scenarios to provide a unified platform to monitor, visualize, and control all the operations of in the Smart City environment.
