[comment]: # (This is the notes on the beacon paper)

## To Do List
1. Find some related work of POI correction. (Almost Done)
2. Define a metric to measure the accuracy of the POI. 

## Discussion with Professor

1. Location correction has been studies many years ago, so it's not a good idea to wirte a paper only on POI correction.
2. For algorithm and related work of location correction, please read Hwang's 2007 paper.
3. The main idea of my paper should be "We build a large scale real world indoor localization system basede on iBeacon protocol. In building this system, we met the following pracitcal problems and address them with novel methods."
4. Currently we have the following topics: "POI correction", "Security", "Risk Control". I can work on these topics and come up with new ones recently.

## Potential Topics
1. POI Correction
2. Security/Authentication
3. Risk Control
4. Auto check-in (Similar to Existence Detection)
