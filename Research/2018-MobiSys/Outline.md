[comment]: # (This is the outline for the 2018 MobiSys paper)


## 1 INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we propose a large scale indoor localization system for the food delivery business based on BLE beacons. 

The pass-loss equation is not applicable due to variety of cellphone platforms and hardware. 

Fingerprinting is not applicable due to large scale, we have to use existing POI information in the database. However, the POI information in the database in inaccurate ...

Commercial application require high security level 


This is the first paper that shows the effectiveness of BLE based beacon in real world commercial application. The scale of the system is larger than any other system studied in the followings aspects: For the physical layer, we have more than 15,000 beacons in 15,000 shops in Shanghai. For the sensor layer, more than 20,000 riders act as "sensors" with cellphone with them. Particularly, in the former studies the many, more than 600 types have cellphone have been involved in the system, which shows the effectiveness of our system in real world scenario. 


## 2 RELATED WORK

## 5 Indoor Detection and Tracking

## 6 POI Correction
### 6.1 Exception Detection
(Almost done, based on riders' speed)

### 6.2 POI Correction
(Not started, plan to use optimization, minimize the exceptional rate)

## 7 System Security
(To be done by LIU Ling?)

## 8 Performance Evaluation
### 8.1 Data source
### 8.2 In-field Experiment

## 9 CONCLUSION
