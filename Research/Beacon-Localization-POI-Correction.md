[comment]: # (This post composite the POI Correction Section)

## Design Space
The design space can be like the following:
* Anchor based localization/detection
* Anchor free localization/detection
    * Bidirectional communication based
    * Bidirectional communication free (Our Work) (We need to claim that we are the first.)

## Notation
\\[ g(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + w_0\\] 

\\[lat_i \\]: The latitude of POI node \\[i\]


## The Metric for POI Accuracy
\\[ \epsilon_i =  \\] 


## Background
Many existing indoor localization methods are using the finger-printing strategy[][]. That is, a training phase is needed before indoor localization can be achieved, which is not pratical for large scale application. Some other studies 


## Motivation
[comment]: # (It will be better to have a small example and some figures)


## POI Exception Detection
[comment]: # (We need first define some metric to measure the exception)

## In-Field Experiment
