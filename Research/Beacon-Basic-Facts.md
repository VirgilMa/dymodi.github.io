[comment]: # (Some basic facts about beaocn)

In this post we gather some basic facts on beacon both from Academia and Industry

According to [1], the beacon proximity is defined as follows:
|Zone       |Distance           |
|-------    |------             |
|Immediate  |<1m                |
|Near       |1-3m               |
|Far        |>3m                |
|Unknow     |Device not ranged  |
