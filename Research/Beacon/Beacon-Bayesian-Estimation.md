[comment]: # (An Estimation of Rider's spatial/temporal point)

In this post, we solve the problem that estimating the rider's arrival/depature time for nearby shops. 

## Arrival/Depature Detection
The Detection is discussed in another [post](https://github.com/dymodi/dymodi.github.io/blob/master/Research/Beacon/Beacon-Rider-Arrival-Depature-Detection.md).
