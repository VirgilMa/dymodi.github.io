I am currently a CS PhD student at University of Minnesota.
My resarch interests are in IoT System and Instant Delivery. 
You can contact me at dymodi AT gmail.

# This site
The creation of this site is motivated by the website from [Todd W. Schneider](http://toddwschneider.com/). Similarly, I will post some articles about my research and study here. If you happen to know Chinese, my [blog](http://blog.csdn.net/dymodi) might be helpful to you.
