This post a summary of clustering methods I learned from [Data Mining course](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/index.php) at UMN.

Basically, clustering methods can be divided into two types: **hierarchical** and **partitional**.



## Type of Clusters


**Well-Separated Clusters**: A cluster is a set of points such that any point in a cluster is closer (or more similar) to every other point in the cluster than to any point not in the cluster. 

**Center-based clusters**: 

**Density-based clusters**





**Confusinon Matrix**
