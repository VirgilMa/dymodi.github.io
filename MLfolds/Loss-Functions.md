In this post, I will summarize some common loss functions in machine learning.

According to Professor Liang in the lecture note of CS221 at Stanford, a loss function Loss$$(x, y, w)$$ quantifies how unhappy you would be if you used $$w$$ to make a prediction on $$x$$ when the correct output is $$y$$. It is the object we want to minimize.
