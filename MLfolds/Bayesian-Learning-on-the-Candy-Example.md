[comment]: # (Use the candy example to explain Bayesian learning)

For the Bayesian learning, Professor Arindam Banerjee has a very good example of candy bages. In this post, we use the candy example to explain and summarize Bayesian learning.

## Bayes Theorem
Before we reach out to Bayesian learning. We need first review the idea of [Beyas Theorem](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/theo-20/www/mlbook/ch6.pdf).
\\[ P(h|D)= \frac{P(D|h)P(h)}{P(D)}\\]

$$P(h)=$$ prior probability of hypothesis $$h$$

## Basic Idea
According to Professor Banerjee, "The Bayesian view of learning is updating probability distribution over the hypothesis space."
