[comment]: # (Some contents about entropy and feature selection)

A short interesting article about "Entropy" is posted in Chinese [here](http://blog.csdn.net/dymodi/article/details/54171509).

This post is based on the content from [Lecture 4: Finding Informative Features - Cosma Shalizi](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350-2006/lecture-04.pdf).
