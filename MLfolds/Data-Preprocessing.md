In this post, we introduce the basic process of data preprocessing (or data clearning). Data preprocessing is not a negligible and this topic is well discussed in the slides from [Indiana](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~predrag/classes/2010springi211/week6_m.pdf) and [WashU](http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~zhang/teaching/cs514/Spring11/Data-prep.pdf). 


## Removing Outliers
According to [WashU](http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~zhang/teaching/cs514/Spring11/Data-prep.pdf), clustering is a good method to detect the outliers in the dataset.
According to a [paper](http://pmg.it.usyd.edu.au/outliers.pdf), k-means can be a practical clustering method.
